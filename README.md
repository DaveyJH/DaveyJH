## About Me

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @DaveyJH. A Junior Software Developer, residing in the South West of
the UK.

I am currently learning with [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net) and
progressing toward a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. I hope to find
my feet and embark on a career in the software development industry.

Originally trained as a mechanic and vehicle diagnostic expert, I developed a
strong background in problem-solving and logical fault-finding. Spending a few
years working with IP video surveillance, addressable fire alarm systems and
various other HID systems gave me a great insight into flow control, cause and
effect programming and a thorough approach to system design.

üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... Coding!

I decided to retrain in the software development industry during 2021. I hope to
develop a broad knowledge base and widen my understanding of languages. I intend
to bring expertise in problem-solving and to create innovative solutions.
