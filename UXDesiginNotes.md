- Specific features that you would like to include
  - Consider trade-off chart to stay within time constraints/capabilities

  - Layout
    - Hierarchical Tree Structure
      - Progress through information with the option to explore a different branch on the same level
    - Nested List
      - Navigation allowing linear routing to more detailed sections
    - Hub and Spoke
      - Main homepage with summary, sub-sections accessible for more info
    - Dashboard
      - Main homepage with brief sub-sections, accessible for more info

- Maintain structure/layout/order to form habits and meet expectations

- **Wireframes**

## Surface

*Specify design decisions and considerations*

- Colour scheme
  - Accessibility
